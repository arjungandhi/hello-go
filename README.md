# hello-go 

hello-go is my first dive into go the end goal is to become competent enough to start developing the tools and resouces to start building and maintaing my own microservices and command line tools to boost productivity and fun! 

# Structure

each folder in this repo is a go package and will be either a command line tool, a program or both!
